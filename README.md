# udacity_dl_face_generation
Assignment-level repo for 'face_generation' from Udacity's Deep Learning nanodegree course

This took a long time! After much trial and error, I found a network architecture for the Generator and Discriminator that was able to generate plausible and detailed faces within one training epoch.
