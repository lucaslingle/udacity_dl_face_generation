# udacity_dl_face_generation

Generate human faces using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks. It's practically magic!

### Remarks

This is an assignment-level repo for 'face_generation' for Udacity's Deep Learning nanodegree course. A number of the function signatures come from the [udacity repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning).

GANs are notoriously hard to train, and this was especially so. After much trial and error, I found a network architecture for the Generator and Discriminator that was able to generate plausible and detailed faces within one training epoch.
